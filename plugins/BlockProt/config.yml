# BlockProt Config

# Load a language file from the plugins/BlockProt/ directory.
# You can create your own language files and edit existing ones.
# Translations can be missing from this file and will instead be loaded
# from "translations_en.yml".
language_file: translations_en.yml

# The fallback string when a translation cannot be found in translations_en
# and the specified language_file above. This often happens when the plugin
# is updated and there are new translations or translations were renamed. Best
# to then delete the lang/ folder and restart the server.
fallback_string: "Unknown translation"

# If this is true, we will copy and replace the translation files on
# each startup. This is so that when you should update this plugin, any
# new or updated translations are automatically copied and applied. If
# you want to modify and included translation file, you will have to make
# this false.
replace_translations: true

# If set to "true", anytime an admin joins the server, they will
# receive an in-game message if this plugin is outdated.
# If set to "false", no message will be sent but /blockprot update
# will still work.
notify_op_of_updates: false

# If set to "true", redstone will be automatically disallowed on every
# placed block, if the player has lock on place enabled.
redstone_disallowed_by_default: false

# A list of world names the plugin should not be usable in.
# The case of each name is ignored.
# Useful for a mining-only world where a block should not be
# owned by anyone. For example:
#   - world_mining
#   - world_end
excluded_worlds: [ ]

# Setting this to 'false' will make every new player have
# their lock and place setting set to of. This will be by
# default set to 'true'.
# Note: This does NOT affect players who have previously
# changed this setting.
lock_on_place_by_default: true

# The maximum amount of blocks a player can lock. If removed
# or set to any negative value, this is interpreted as setting
# no limit.
